# Store_Sales_Analysis
This project is based on a store sales dataset I downloaded from kaggle, the dataset contains simulated daily sales records for 10 retail stores across a two-year period (2022â€“2023). I have used it for analyzing retail store sales per store and the impact promotions and holidays have on sales.
